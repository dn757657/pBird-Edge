# pBird-Edge
Custom FDP focused training edge for climbers. This device is intended to be an ergonomic egde, that focuses on training the FDP tendon(s). Tendon isolation is acheived by enforcing certain joint angles when lifting, when the intended form is lost or can no longer be held, the rollers force the user to drop the device (heavy inspiration from NS Climber Mobeta and his Hand of God training device). The joint angles are enforced by the geometry of the device.
